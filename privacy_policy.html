  <p><strong>Last Updated: January 4, 2024</strong></p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing Tides Explorer! This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Don't Collect</h2>

  <p>Tides Explorer does not collect, store, or share any personal information from its users. We believe in protecting your privacy, and as a result, we have designed our app to operate without the need for any personal data.</p>

  <h2>2. Location Data</h2>

  <p>Tides Explorer may request access to your device's location services to provide accurate tide information based on your current location. However, this information is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted or stored by us.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Cookies</h2>

  <p>Tides Explorer does not use any analytics tools or cookies that track your usage patterns. We prioritize user privacy and aim to provide a seamless experience without compromising your personal information.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>Tides Explorer utilizes tide information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through their tide APIs.

  <p>Your interaction with Tides Explorer remains confidential and secure. We do not integrate with any additional third-party services or APIs that would require the sharing of user data beyond what is necessary for obtaining tide information.</p>

  <p>For more information on NOAA's privacy practices, you can refer to their privacy policy, which is separate from Tides Explorer's privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

  <p>Tides Explorer is intended for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately, and we will take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy in the app. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
